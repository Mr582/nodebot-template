Nodebot Template
================

This is a template for Nodechat bots.

Usage:

You need Node.JS installed, which can be found at http://nodejs.org/.

You'll need to clone the Github repository (Google it if you don't know how) then run ```npm install``` in the directory that you cloned the repository to. This will install dependencies. Next, rename ```config.example.json``` to ```config.json```.

To run the template, use your Nodechat botkey (generated by running ```/botkey``` in Nodechat) in place of ```key``` in ```config.json```. The default IP and port should be fine to connect. Finally, in the directory that you cloned to, just run ```node nodebot.js```.

It'll connect, but there aren't any commands built in. That's for you to do. Learn Node.JS to write commands, and have fun with it!
